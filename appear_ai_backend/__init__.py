"""
Package initializer for the appear_ai_backend project.

This package contains modules for querying generative AI APIs, parsing
webâ€‘server log files to identify visits from AI bots, generating
recommendation reports and exposing a simple FastAPI application to
drive the service. The code is intentionally modular so that
individual components can be reused or extended.

Note: API keys and external credentials should be provided via
environment variables or a configuration file. This package does not
embed any secrets.
